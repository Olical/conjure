= Conjure Sourcery

____
As they say in Discworld, we are trying to unravel the Mighty Infinite using a language which was designed to tell one another where the fresh fruit was.

— Terry Pratchett in Sourcery 
____

A reimplementation of Conjure (master branch) in Lua via https://github.com/bakpakin/Fennel[Fennel]. This is mostly made possible by my precursor project to this one, https://github.com/Olical/aniseed[Aniseed]. It's a toolkit that aids development of Neovim plugins and configuration through Fennel.
