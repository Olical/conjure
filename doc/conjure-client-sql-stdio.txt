INTRODUCTION                        *conjure-client-sql-stdio-introduction*
>
  SQL is a programming language for working with relational database
  management systems (RDBMS).

Conjure starts a SQL REPL within Neovim when you first open a SQL file unless
you set `conjure#client_on_load` to `v:false`.

This client was initially developed using PostgreSQL's `psql` command line
client. Thus, the default configuration values for the `command` and `prompt
`pattern` are set for `psql` to use a connection URL for a local a PostgreSQL
server running on your local computer listening on the default port, a
`postgres` database, and a `postgres` user with a password of `postgres`.

Please note that connecting to databases can be a security risk so consult the
appropriate people for your particular situation and environment.
  
If you set up a `~/.pgpass` password file for PostgreSQL, like so:

  -- host:port:db:user:password
  localhost:5432:postgres:postgres:postgres

You can use a command string like:

  "psql -h localhost -U postgres"

or

  "psql postgres://postgres@localhost"

 - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/libpq-pgpass.html

See |conjure-client-sql-stdio-configuration| and the documentation for the SQL
command line client that you want to use.

Once configured, you should be able to evaluate files and forms as you would
with other Conjure supported languages.

Check out `:ConjureSchool` if you're unsure about what evaluation operations
you can perform.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                *conjure-client-sql-stdio-mappings*

These mappings are the defaults, you can change them as described in
|conjure-mappings| and |conjure-configuration|.

See |conjure-client-sql-stdio-configuration| for specific configuration
options relevant to these mappings.

<localleader>cs          Start the SQL REPL if it's not running already.

<localleader>cS          Stop any existing SQL REPL.

<localleader>ei          Interrupt the current SQL REPL.

                         *NOTE:* This depends on the program you run for
                         a REPL. On macos, when running a `\watch`
                         meta-command in `psql`, this works to stop it. But
                         during normal interaction, this will kill the REPL so
                         you will need to restart it.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                      *conjure-client-sql-stdio-configuration*

All configuration can be set as described in |conjure-configuration|.


                                 *g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#mapping#start*
`g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#mapping#start`
            Start the SQL REPL if it's not running already.
            Default: `"cs"`

                                  *g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#mapping#stop*
`g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#mapping#stop`
            Stop any existing SQL REPL.
            Default: `"cS"`

                           *g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#mapping#eval_reload*
`g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#mapping#interrupt`
            Interrupt the SQL REPL.
            Default: `"ei"`

                                       *g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#command*
`g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#command`
            Command used to start the SQL REPL, modify to meet your needs.
            Default: `"psql postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/postgres"`

                                *g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#prompt_pattern*
`g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#prompt_pattern`
            Lua pattern to identify a new REPL prompt. This match signals to
            Conjure that the previous evaluation is complete and we're ready
            to submit more code as well as collect all output prior to the
            marker as the result.
            Default: `"=> "`

                           *g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#meta_prefix_pattern*
`g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#meta_prefix_pattern`
            Lua pattern to identify meta commands that do not require a `;`
            suffix. Commands such as `\watch` in postgresql and `.tables` in
            duckdb. When Conjure spots one of these it will avoid appending a
            semi-colon which is required to execute true statements.
            Default: `"^[.\\]%w"`

==============================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING                         *conjure-client-sql-stdio-trouble*

If you get an error message like "SQLComplete:The dbext plugin must be loaded
for dynamic SQL completion", you add this Vimscript to your Neovim configuration:

  " Default to static completion for SQL
  let g:omni_sql_default_compl_type = 'syntax'

The equivalent Lua would be:

  vim.g["omni_sql_default_compl_type"] = 'syntax'
