INTRODUCTION                        *conjure-client-sql-stdio-introduction*
>
  SQL is a programming language for working with relational database
  management systems (RDBMS).

Conjure starts a SQL REPL within Neovim when you first open a SQL file unless
you set `conjure#client_on_load` to `v:false`.

This client was initially developed using PostgresQL's `psql` command line
client. Thus, the default configuration values for the `command` and `prompt
`pattern` are set for `psql` set up with a `~/.pgpass` password file for
a PostgresQL server running on your local computer listening on the default
port, a `postgres` database, and a `blogger` database user with a password of
`secret`. Please note that connecting to databases can be a security risk so
consult the appropriate people for your particular situation and environment.

See |conjure-client-sql-stdio-configuration| and the documentation for the SQL
command line client that you want to use.

Once configured, you should be able to evaluate files and forms as you would
with other Conjure supported languages.

Check out `:ConjureSchool` if you're unsure about what evaluation operations
you can perform.

MAPPINGS                                *conjure-client-sql-stdio-mappings*

These mappings are the defaults, you can change them as described in
|conjure-mappings| and |conjure-configuration|.

See |conjure-client-sql-stdio-configuration| for specific configuration
options relevant to these mappings.

<localleader>cs          Start the SQL REPL if it's not running already.

<localleader>cS          Stop any existing SQL REPL.

<localleader>ei          Interrupt the current SQL REPL. May need restart.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                      *conjure-client-sql-stdio-configuration*

All configuration can be set as described in |conjure-configuration|.


                                 *g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#mapping#start*
`g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#mapping#start`
            Start the SQL REPL if it's not running already.
            Default: `"cs"`

                                  *g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#mapping#stop*
`g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#mapping#stop`
            Stop any existing SQL REPL.
            Default: `"cS"`

                           *g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#mapping#eval_reload*
`g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#mapping#interrupt`
            Interrupt the SQL REPL.
            Default: `"ei"`

                                       *g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#command*
`g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#command`
            Command used to start the SQL REPL, you can modify this to add
            arguments or change the command entirely.
            Default: `"psql -U blogger postgres"`

                                *g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#prompt_pattern*
`g:conjure#client#sql#stdio#prompt_pattern`
            Lua pattern to identify a new REPL prompt. This match signals to
            Conjure that the previous evaluation is complete and we're ready
            to submit more code as well as collect all output prior to the
            marker as the result.
            Default: `"=> "`
