INTRODUCTION                        *conjure-client-snd-s7-stdio-introduction*
>
  Snd is a sound editor created by Bill Schottstaedt <bil@ccrma.stanford.edu>
  of the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA). It can
  be scripted or extended using the S7 Scheme interpreter built into it. In
  this document, snd-s7 is used to refer to the program which is named snd.

This client conflicts with the Scheme client due to the same filetype suffix.

To use this instead of the default Scheme client, add this Vimscript to your
Neovim configuration:

  let g:conjure#filetype#scheme = "conjure.client.snd-s7.stdio"

The equivalent Lua would be:

  vim.g["conjure#filetype#scheme"] = "conjure.client.snd-s7.stdio"

Conjure starts a snd-s7 REPL within Neovim when you first open a snd-s7
(`.scm`) file. You can configure how the snd-s7 REPL is launched with the
`g:conjure#client#snd-s7#stdio#command` configuration option.

You should be able to evaluate files and forms as you would with other Conjure
supported languages right away.

Check out `:ConjureSchool` if you're unsure about what evaluation operations
you can perform.

MAPPINGS                                *conjure-client-snd-s7-stdio-mappings*

These mappings are the defaults, you can change them as described in
|conjure-mappings| and |conjure-configuration|.

See |conjure-client-snd-s7-stdio-configuration| for specific configuration
options relevant to these mappings.

<localleader>cs          Start the snd-s7 REPL if it's not running already.

<localleader>cS          Stop any existing snd-s7 REPL.

<localleader>ei          Interrupt running command. Same as pressing Ctrl-C
                         in a cmdline REPL. This may actually stop the REPL.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                      *conjure-client-snd-s7-stdio-configuration*

All configuration can be set as described in |conjure-configuration|.

                                 *g:conjure#client#snd-s7#stdio#mapping#start*
`g:conjure#client#snd-s7#stdio#mapping#start`
            Start the snd-s7 REPL if it's not running already.
            Default: `"cs"`

                                  *g:conjure#client#snd-s7#stdio#mapping#stop*
`g:conjure#client#snd-s7#stdio#mapping#stop`
            Stop any existing snd-s7 REPL.
            Default: `"cS"`

                                       *g:conjure#client#snd-s7#stdio#command*
`g:conjure#client#snd-s7#stdio#command`
            Command used to start the snd-s7 REPL, you can modify this to add
            arguments or change the command entirely.

            When using a different REPL you'll probably have to change the
            `prompt_pattern` too! Have a look at the default REPL output and
            write a Lua pattern that will match that prompt string as best as
            you can.

            Default: `"snd"`

                                *g:conjure#client#snd-s7#stdio#prompt_pattern*
`g:conjure#client#snd-s7#stdio#prompt_pattern`
            This is not used by this client module.
            Default: `"> "`
