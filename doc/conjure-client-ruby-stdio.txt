INTRODUCTION                       *conjure-client-ruby-stdio-introduction*
>
  irb is an interactive tool (Ruby REPL) used to execute Ruby expressions.

Conjure starts a Ruby REPL within Neovim when you first open a Ruby (`.rb`)
file. You can configure how the Ruby REPL is launched with the
`g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#command` configuration option.

You should be able to evaluate files and forms as you would with other Conjure
supported languages right away.

Check out `:ConjureSchool` if you're unsure about what evaluation operations
you can perform.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                               *conjure-client-ruby-stdio-mappings*

These mappings are the defaults, you can change them as described in
|conjure-mappings| and |conjure-configuration|.

See |conjure-client-ruby-stdio-configuration| for specific configuration
options relevant to these mappings.

<localleader>cs          Start the Ruby REPL if it's not running already.

<localleader>cS          Stop any existing Ruby REPL.

<localleader>ei          Interrupt running command. Same as pressing Ctrl-C
                         in a cmdline REPL.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                     *conjure-client-ruby-stdio-configuration*

All configuration can be set as described in |conjure-configuration|.

These items are specific to the Ruby client.

                                 *g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#mapping#start*
`g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#mapping#start`
            Start the Ruby REPL if it's not running already.
            Default: `"cs"`

                                  *g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#mapping#stop*
`g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#mapping#stop`
            Stop any existing Ruby REPL.
            Default: `"cS"`

                             *g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#mapping#interrupt*
`g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#mapping#interrupt`
            Send an interrupt signal to the REPL. Useful for hung processes.
            Default: `"ei"`

                                       *g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#command*
`g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#command`
            Command used to start the Ruby REPL, you can modify this to add
            arguments or change the command entirely.

            See https://ruby.github.io/irb/ for command line options and
            configuration. You can store the command line options in a
            configutation file, e.g. "$HOME/.config/irb/irbrc" ".irbrc" in the
            current directory. See
            https://ruby.github.io/irb/Configurations_md.html for details.

            Please note that this client was built using the default options
            so that the automated interaction is easier to parse. Hence, the
            use of at least "--noecho-on-assignment" and
            "--simple-prompt". The other options, "--no-pager",
            "--nocolorize", and "--noautocomplete", help to minimize suprious
            interactions from REPL.

            Default: `"irb --no-pager --nocolorize --noautocomplete --noecho-on-assignment --simple-prompt"`

                                *g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#prompt_pattern*
`g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#prompt_pattern`
            Lua pattern to identify a new REPL prompt. This match signals to
            Conjure that the previous evaluation is complete and we're ready
            to submit more code as well as collect all output prior to the
            marker as the result.
            Default: `">> "`

                          *g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#value_prefix_pattern*
`g:conjure#client#ruby#stdio#value_prefix_pattern`
            Lua pattern to identify a return value output as opposed to a
            printed, non-code, string.
            Default: `"=> "`
