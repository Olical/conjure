INTRODUCTION                          *conjure-client-python-stdio-introduction*
>
  Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and
  integrate your systems more effectively.

Conjure starts a Python REPL within Neovim when you first open a Python file.

Once you have tree sitter installed and configured (remember to run
`:TSInstall python`!) you should be able to evaluate forms just like you would
in any other Conjure supported language.

Check out `:ConjureSchool` if you're unsure about what evaluation operations
you can perform.

MAPPINGS                                  *conjure-client-python-stdio-mappings*

These mappings are the defaults, you can change them as described in
|conjure-mappings| and |conjure-configuration|.

See |conjure-client-python-stdio-configuration| for specific configuration
options relevant to these mappings.

<localleader>cs          Start the Python REPL if it's not running already.

<localleader>cS          Stop any existing Python REPL.

<localleader>ei          Interrupt running command. Same as pressing Ctrl-C
                         in a cmdline REPL.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                        *conjure-client-python-stdio-configuration*

All configuration can be set as described in |conjure-configuration|.


                                 *g:conjure#client#python#stdio#mapping#start*
`g:conjure#client#python#stdio#mapping#start`
            Start the Python REPL if it's not running already.
            Default: `"cs"`

                                  *g:conjure#client#python#stdio#mapping#stop*
`g:conjure#client#python#stdio#mapping#stop`
            Stop any existing Python REPL.
            Default: `"cS"`

                                       *g:conjure#client#python#stdio#command*
`g:conjure#client#python#stdio#command`
            Command used to start the Python REPL, you can modify this to add
            arguments or change the command entirely.
            Default: `"python3 -iq"`

                                *g:conjure#client#python#stdio#prompt_pattern*
`g:conjure#client#python#stdio#prompt_pattern`
            Lua pattern to identify a new REPL prompt. This match signals to
            Conjure that the previous evaluation is complete and we're ready
            to submit more code as well as collect all output prior to the
            marker as the result.
            Default: `">>> "`
