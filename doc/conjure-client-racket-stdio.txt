INTRODUCTION                        *conjure-client-racket-stdio-introduction*
>
  Racket is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language based on
  the Scheme dialect of Lisp. It is designed to be a platform for programming
  language design and implementation.

Conjure starts a Racket REPL within Neovim when you first open a Racket file.

You should be able to evaluate files and forms as you would with other Conjure
supported languages right away.

Check out `:ConjureSchool` if you're unsure about what evaluation operations
you can perform.

MAPPINGS                                *conjure-client-racket-stdio-mappings*

These mappings are the defaults, you can change them as described in
|conjure-mappings| and |conjure-configuration|.

See |conjure-client-racket-stdio-configuration| for specific configuration
options relevant to these mappings.

<localleader>cs          Start the Racket REPL if it's not running already.

<localleader>cS          Stop any existing Racket REPL.

<localleader>ei          Send an interrupt signal to the REPL. Useful for
                         hanging processes or unbalanced parenthesis.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                      *conjure-client-racket-stdio-configuration*

All configuration can be set as described in |conjure-configuration|.


                                 *g:conjure#client#racket#stdio#mapping#start*
`g:conjure#client#racket#stdio#mapping#start`
            Start the Racket REPL if it's not running already.
            Default: `"cs"`

                                  *g:conjure#client#racket#stdio#mapping#stop*
`g:conjure#client#racket#stdio#mapping#stop`
            Stop any existing Racket REPL.
            Default: `"cS"`

                             *g:conjure#client#racket#stdio#mapping#interrupt*
`g:conjure#client#racket#stdio#mapping#interrupt`
            Send an interrupt signal to the REPL. Useful for hanging processes
            or unbalanced parenthesis.
            Default: `"ei"`

                                       *g:conjure#client#racket#stdio#command*
`g:conjure#client#racket#stdio#command`
            Command used to start the Racket REPL, you can modify this to add
            arguments or change the command entirely.
            Default: `"racket"`

                                *g:conjure#client#racket#stdio#prompt_pattern*
`g:conjure#client#racket#stdio#prompt_pattern`
            Lua pattern to identify a new REPL prompt. This match signals to
            Conjure that the previous evaluation is complete and we're ready
            to submit more code as well as collect all output prior to the
            marker as the result.
            Default: `"\n?[\"%w%-./_]*> "`
