INTRODUCTION                            *conjure-client-php-psysh-introduction*

  A popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.
  Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the most popular websites in the world.

Conjure starts a PHP REPL within Neovim when you first open a PHP file.

You should be able to evaluate files and forms as you would with other Conjure
supported languages right away.

Check out `:ConjureSchool` if you're unsure about what evaluation operations
you can perform.

MAPPINGS                                    *conjure-client-php-psysh-mappings*

These mappings are the defaults, you can change them as described in
|conjure-mappings| and |conjure-configuration|.

See |conjure-client-php-psysh-configuration| for specific configuration
options relevant to these mappings.

<localleader>cs          Start the PHP REPL if it's not running already.

<localleader>cS          Stop any existing PHP REPL.

<localleader>ei          Interrupt running command. Same as pressing Ctrl-C
                         in a cmdline REPL.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                          *conjure-client-php-psysh-configuration*

All configuration can be set as described in |conjure-configuration|.


                                     *g:conjure#client#php#psysh#mapping#start*
`g:conjure#client#php#psysh#mapping#start`
            Start the php REPL if it's not running already.
            Default: `"cs"`

                                      *g:conjure#client#php#psysh#mapping#stop*
`g:conjure#client#php#psysh#mapping#stop`
            Stop any existing php REPL.
            Default: `"cS"`

                                 *g:conjure#client#php#psysh#mapping#interrupt*
`g:conjure#client#php#psysh#mapping#interrupt`
            Interrupt running command. Same as pressing Ctrl-C in a cmdline
            REPL.
            Default: `"ei"`

                                           *g:conjure#client#php#psysh#command*
`g:conjure#client#php#psysh#command`
            Command used to start the php REPL, you can modify this to add
            arguments or change the command entirely.
            Default: `"psysh -ir --no-color"`

                                    *g:conjure#client#php#psysh#prompt_pattern*
`g:conjure#client#php#psysh#prompt_pattern`
            Lua pattern to identify a new REPL prompt. This match signals to
            Conjure that the previous evaluation is complete and we're ready
            to submit more code as well as collect all output prior to the
            marker as the result.
            Default: `"> "`
