INTRODUCTION                        *conjure-client-scheme-stdio-introduction*
>
  MIT/GNU Scheme is an implementation of the Scheme programming language.

Conjure starts an MIT Scheme REPL within Neovim when you first open a Scheme
(`.scm`) file. You can configure which Scheme REPL is launched with the
`g:conjure#client#scheme#stdio#command` configuration option.

You should be able to evaluate files and forms as you would with other Conjure
supported languages right away.

Check out `:ConjureSchool` if you're unsure about what evaluation operations
you can perform.

MAPPINGS                                *conjure-client-scheme-stdio-mappings*

These mappings are the defaults, you can change them as described in
|conjure-mappings| and |conjure-configuration|.

See |conjure-client-scheme-stdio-configuration| for specific configuration
options relevant to these mappings.

<localleader>cs          Start the Scheme REPL if it's not running already.

<localleader>cS          Stop any existing Scheme REPL.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                      *conjure-client-scheme-stdio-configuration*

All configuration can be set as described in |conjure-configuration|.

                                 *g:conjure#client#scheme#stdio#mapping#start*
`g:conjure#client#scheme#stdio#mapping#start`
            Start the Scheme REPL if it's not running already.
            Default: `"cs"`

                                  *g:conjure#client#scheme#stdio#mapping#stop*
`g:conjure#client#scheme#stdio#mapping#stop`
            Stop any existing Scheme REPL.
            Default: `"cS"`

                                       *g:conjure#client#scheme#stdio#command*
`g:conjure#client#scheme#stdio#command`
            Command used to start the Scheme REPL, you can modify this to add
            arguments or change the command entirely.

            When using a different REPL you'll probably have to change the
            `prompt_pattern` too! Have a look at the default REPL output and
            write a Lua pattern that will match that prompt string as best as
            you can.

            Default: `"mit-scheme"`

                                *g:conjure#client#scheme#stdio#prompt_pattern*
`g:conjure#client#scheme#stdio#prompt_pattern`
            Lua pattern to identify a new REPL prompt. This match signals to
            Conjure that the previous evaluation is complete and we're ready
            to submit more code as well as collect all output prior to the
            marker as the result.
            Default: `"[%]e][=r]r?o?r?> "`

                          *g:conjure#client#scheme#stdio#value_prefix_pattern*
`g:conjure#client#scheme#stdio#value_prefix_pattern`
            Lua pattern to identify a value output as opposed to a printed,
            non-code, string. This is mostly only useful with `mit-scheme`
            which prefixes values with `Value:`, for other REPLs (such as
            Chez) you should either adapt this pattern to their value string
            or set it to `v:false` to turn it off entirely and treat
            everything as a value.
            Default: `"^;Value: "`
