; Returns whether the string passed in is a simple python
; expression or something more complicated. If it is an expression,
; it can be passed to the REPL as is.
; Otherwise, we evaluate it as a multiline string using "exec". This is a simple
; way for us to not worry about extra or missing newlines in the middle of the code
; we are trying to evaluate at the REPL.
;
; For example, this Python code:
;   for i in range(5):
;       print(i)
;   def foo():
;       print("bar")
; while valid Python code, would not work in the REPL because the REPL expects 2 newlines
; after the for loop body.
;
; In addition, this Python code:
;   for i in range(5):
;       print(i)
;
;       print(i)
; while also valid Python code, would not work in the REPL because the REPL thinks the for loop
; body is over after the first "print(i)" (because it is followed by 2 newlines).
;
; Sending statements like these as a multiline string to Python's exec seems to be a decent workaround
; for this. Another option that I have seen used in some other similar projects is sending the statement
; as a "bracketed paste" (https://cirw.in/blog/bracketed-paste) so the REPL treats the input as if it were
; "pasted", but I couldn't get this working.
